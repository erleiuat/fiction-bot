- #1 DBAA / Don't be an asshole

Stay respectful in chat and don't get on others' nerves unnecessarily. We don't need racism, anti-Semitism or intolerance among each other. Likewise, there is no need to destroy other people's stuff with the sole purpose of destroying it (see rule #2/#3).

- #2 No purposeless destruction

Of course you can destroy walls and pick locks to get the loot, but destroying campfires, wells or crates doesn't help anyone.

- #3 No destruction of vehicles

The vehicles of others should not be destroyed senselessly and wantonly. Exceptions can be situations where it makes sense to immobilize the opponent.

- #4 No Bambi kills

Players who have just spawned and are still wearing the orange prisoner gear are considered Bambi. The Bambi protection will vanish as soon as you carry weapons or a backpack (which could contain weapons). Exceptions can be situations, where it makes sense to hold down the enemy after respawning.

- #5 Maximum 1 vehicle per player + 1 spare vehicle per squad

So to avoid that vehicles lose their value, we restrict the ownership. Random inspections will be carried out. If a squad has too many vehicles, the most worthless one will be deleted without warning (including the contents). So if you have too many vehicles, it is better to sell them in the trade zone to needy players.

- #6 Write in English or German and donâ€™t spam

If someone communicates too long or too much in other languages via the global chat or spams advertisements etc., we can permanently mute this player. Requests for de-muting can be left in the support channel.

- #7 No thievery in in the Tradingzone B2

While getting the starter kit or buying things it would be possible for other players to steal the items. Since we can't avoid this any better, we forbid the theft of items lying around inside the trading zone. Also the theft of non-locked vehicles is forbidden in the trading zone.

If there is any suspicion of a rule violation, we require video evidence from the complainant in every case. We will not spawn you a box full of katanas just because you say that someone destroyed them willfully despite rule #2. However, if you have recorded someone destroying your vehicle for no reason, we will replace it and try to bring the perpetrator to justice.
