**Additional Bot-Commands for Mods:**

`/whois [username]` will show some info about a user (just like `/whoami`). When used in in global chat, the bot will respond in global as well, but if you use it in local you will only see the response if you are close enough to the Bot (in B2).

`/reset [username]` will (so far only) reset the starterkit of the user so he can get a new one. Usually users aren't supposed to get more than one, but if the reasoning is good enough (no need to be too serious) it's okay.

`/reload` will restart FiBo without restarting the whole PC he runs on. This could solve some issues in case the bot doesn't answer anymore etc.

`/reboot` will restart the PC FiBo runs on completely, which could take some time. This should only be used when `/reload` couldn't solve the issue.


If reload/reboot commands are not working ingame, it's probably because the whole Bot-Service crashed completely. In this case the last hope is for the Discord-Handler Service to still be running fine.
The same commands can be used everywhere on the Discord server as well. If your message gets deleted right after you send it, it means that the command was successful and the bot should reload/restart soon.
