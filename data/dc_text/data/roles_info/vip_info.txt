__**VIP ROLE INFO**__



As a VIP you have extended rights ingame as well as some discounts :wink:


The first and probably most important command is `/reload`. It can be used ingame as well as anywhere on the Discord server.
`/reload` will restart FiBo without restarting the whole PC he runs on. This could solve some issues in case the bot doesn't answer anymore etc.

In the worst case, if `/reload` didn't do the job, you can also run `/reboot`.
`/reboot` will restart the PC FiBo runs on completely, which could take some time. This should only be used when `/reload` couldn't solve the issue.


If the commands are not working ingame, it probably is because the whole Bot-Service crashed completely. In this case the last hope is for the Discord-Handler Service to still be running fine.
The same commands can be used everywhere on the Discord server as well. If your message gets deleted right after you send it, it means that the command was successful and the bot should reload/restart soon.
